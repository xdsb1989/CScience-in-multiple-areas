(A)    Using the windows7 operator system,and compile the program on Dec-Cpp platform.If you can use the Dev-Cpp, open the Dev-Cpp and click file->open project or file->choose the existed C source code.
      If you are the first time to use Dev-Cpp,click tools->complier options->directions,and then add the absolute path C:\MinGW\bin to Binaries,pop it at the first position;add the absolute path C:\MinGW\lib to libraries,pop it at the first position;add the absolute path C:\MinGW\include to C Includes,pop it at the first position(You may have a different path to install the MinGW,using your own path,the "C:\MinGW\" just an example)
      Click execute->compile&run.After the compiling,the commander window will comes out and then you need to input some code to run the program.


(B)    After the commander window comes out, you can input the absolute path of the file(include the name of the file and .txt,and when you input ＾\￣,you should change to ＾\\￣).
    The file saves the name of each vertex,and the format of the file will be two vertexes in one 	line, separated by a space.You can create several lines which represent the edges in the graph, 	and don¨t repeat the same line in twice,that means keep all the lines are different, and make sure the graph you input is a connected graph.
